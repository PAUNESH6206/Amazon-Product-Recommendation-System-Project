# Amazon Product Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system for Amazon products, providing personalized product suggestions to users based on their past behavior and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to improve recommendation quality.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses product and user data.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user-product interactions to recommend products.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends similar products based on product attributes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's accuracy using precision, recall, and RMSE.
- **Scalability:** The system can scale to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Project Structure
- `Amazon Product Recommendation System.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanation.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for this project.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models for recommendations (if any).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Amazon-Product-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Amazon-Product-Recommendation-System
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells:

jupyter notebook Amazon\ Product\ Recommendation\ System.ipynb

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains product details and user interaction data from Amazon. You can obtain the dataset from the official Amazon dataset source or use any dataset of your choice. Ensure that the data is in the data/ directory.

# How It Works
# Data Loading:
The dataset is loaded and prepared for training.
# Exploratory Data Analysis:
Analyze user-product interactions, product categories, and reviews.
Building the Recommendation System:
# Collaborative Filtering:
Uses matrix factorization techniques.
# Content-Based Filtering:
Uses product features and similarities.
# Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using a validation set and performance metrics.
# Deployment:
The system can be deployed as an API or integrated into an e-commerce platform.
# Libraries Used
pandas,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
surprise (for collaborative filtering).
# Results
The recommendation system provides accurate suggestions based on user history and product similarity. Precision and recall are used to measure the effectiveness of the recommendations.
